# Takedown using DMCA

{% hint style="danger" %}
B**efore you make a DMCA request**

* you should always try to contact the owner(s) of the site! Some site admins take your content of their site if you ask. DMCAs should be your last option!
* you should make sure that your work is copyrighted (e.g. you haven't added any other licenses)\


**THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE!** You should always inform yourself about the legal consequences of filing such a legal request!
{% endhint %}

### How to get the contact info

**Getting the owner(s) info**: Most of the time, these sites have some kind of contact form or their email in the footer of the site (at the bottom).

**Getting the host/registrar info**: You can use a WHOIS service like [this one](https://hostadvice.com/tools/whois/) to get info about the registrar/host (preferably look for the host's details). After you've found the name of the host, you can look it up. Most of the time they have an abuse form or an abuse email.

### How to write a DMCA request

I've taken the templates from [this site](https://kinsta.com/blog/dmca-takedown-notice/#issue-dmca-takedown-notice). Before you file a DMCA request, please contact the owner(s) of the site before, like so:

```
Hello,
I have discovered your website (https://domain.com) has been using content I own.
Here are some examples of my content:

https://yourdomain.com/~ [EXACT CONTENT/IMAGE LOCATION]
https://yourdomain.com/~

—
And here are copies on your site:

https://domain.com/~ [EXACT CONTENT/IMAGE LOCATION]
https://domain.com/~

Please remove all copyrighted content belonging to me immediately otherwise I'll have to proceed with filing a DMCA complaint. If you have any questions regarding this, let me know. 

Thanks
```

If the owner(s) don't respond after 1-2 weeks, or they're not willing to take it down (and don't have any legitimate reason not to do) you can file a DMCA takedown request as follows:

```
